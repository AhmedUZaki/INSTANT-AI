The first node of the linked list represents the vertex and the remaining lists connected to this node represents the vertices to which this node is connected. This representation can also be used to represent a weighted graph. The linked list can slightly be changed to even store the weight of the edge.\n",
    "2. **Adjacency Matrix:** Adjacency Matrix is a [2D array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/multidimensional-arrays-in-java/) of size V x V where V is the number of vertices in a graph. Let the 2D array be adj[][], a slot adj[i][j] = 1 indicates that there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. Adjacency matrix for undirected graph is always symmetric. Adjacency Matrix is also used to represent weighted graphs. If adj[i][j] = w, then there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j with weight w.\n",
