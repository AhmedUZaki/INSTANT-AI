  -  SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. 

  -  It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process. â€‹

- #### Programming Language vs. Framework :
  
  
  - Programming languages are nothing more than a set of rules by which you make a computer do what you want.
  
  - Frameworks are tools that help to increase the efficiency of using a specific language, be it JavaScript, PHP, or Python. However, they help to achieve incredible results.
  
  - Frameworks are based on one programming language but can contain more programming languages or tools for better performance.
  
  - Programming languages are more flexible than frameworks.
  
    
  


### Tasks:
