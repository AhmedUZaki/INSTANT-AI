  -  SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. 
  -  It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.


- #### UML diagrams:

  -  Entity relationship diagram
  -  Use case diagram
  -  Sequence diagram
  -  Activity diagram
  -  Class diagram

- #### Programming Language vs. Framework:
  
  
  - Programming languages are nothing more than a set of rules by which you make a computer do what you want.
  
  - Frameworks are tools that help to increase the efficiency of using a specific language, be it JavaScript, PHP, or Python. However, they help to achieve incredible results.
  
  - Frameworks are based on one programming language but can contain more programming languages or tools for better performance.
  
  - Programming languages are more flexible than frameworks.
  
- #### Software Models:  

  - **Waterfall Model**

    ​    The Waterfall Model was the first Process Model to be introduced. It is also referred to as a **linear-sequential life cycle model**. In a waterfall model, each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.
  
  
    - No working software is produced until late during the life cycle.
  
  - **Agile Model**

    - They do this by breaking up the traditionally long delivery cycle (typical of the legacy “waterfall methods”) into shorter periods, called sprints or iterations.
    -  The iteration provides the cadence for delivering a working product to the customer, getting feedback and making changes based on the feedback.
  
  - **DevOps Model**
  
    <p align="center">

    - DevOps is about removing the barriers between traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. 
    - Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations.
  
  - **DevSecOps Model**
  
    <p align="center">

    - **DevSecOps** is the natural extension of DevOps and Agile cultures to incorporate Security as a main concern.

  - DataOps
  
  - MlOps


### Tasks:

1. What is ternary search?
2. Crash course about **UML diagrams**.
3. Learn clean code:
    -  Turn Spaghetti code into Clean code.
    -  [Clean Code - Uncle Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EmboKQH8lM&list=PLmmYSbUCWJ4x1GO839azG_BBw8rkh-zOj).
4. What is the most common design patterns?
5. Agile vs DevOps.
6. What are used tools in DevOps?
