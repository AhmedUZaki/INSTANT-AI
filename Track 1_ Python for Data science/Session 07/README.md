- **What is object-oriented programming?**

- **OOP Basic Concepts** (Abstraction, Encapsulation).

### Notes:

- #### **What is object-oriented programming?** 

  - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design **around data, or objects**.

  -  An **object** can be defined as a data field that has **unique attributes and behavior (functions)**.

  - **OOP advantages:**

    - Easy to modify.
    - More secure.

  - **OOP disadvantages:**

    - Slow execution.

      

- #### **OOP have:**

    - **Constructor** (Automatically runs functions when creating a new object.)

    - **Destructor** (Destructor is a special method that is called when an object gets destroyed.)

      
    
- #### **OOP Tips:**
    - It's recommended to capitalize the first letter when naming a `class`.

    - `self` isn't the only allowed keyword to represent object .

    - To put **attributes** in the Constructor, or any other functions ,We have to put `self. ` before the variable name. (e.g. `self.name = None`).

    - `__` used to specify private visibility.

    - Any function in `Class` can access anything (either  private or public) .

      
    
- #### **OOP Basic Concepts:**

    1. **Abstraction**
       - **User** -> Use the application in fewest # of steps (e.g. ATM withdraw process).
       - **Coding** -> Make the `Class` very basic (generalized) (e.g. Default Pes6 new player).
    2. **Encapsulation**
       - Hide some information (Attributes / Functions) from the user temporarily, until he proves that he has the right to access it, for Security or Business reasons.
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphism
    5. Composition
