- #### Software Models:  

  - **Ops work together to form a Platform Ops for AI** [[Article]](https://www.scalesology.com/post/dataops-and-mlops-an-extension-of-the-devops-framework-for-data-analytics)

	- **MLOps Model** 
	  - MLOps = Machine Learning + Development + Operation. 
	  - ML teams include *data engineers, data scientists, data analysts, and DevOps team representative(s)*.
	  - MLOps combines data scientists with operations to facilitate the automated deployment, management, and monitoring of machine learning models into large-scale production environments

	- **DataOps Model** 
	  - DataOps is a reference of *how Data Engineers and DevOps engineers work together*. 
	  - DataOps extends the DevOps framework and statistical process control (SPC) to data analytics.
	  - It promotes the collaboration between **DevOps** teams and **data teams** to manage and maintain the quality of data pipelines and reduce cycle time of data insights to end-users.

- #### Microservices / Web Service:  

  - In order to **simplify the workflow with big applications**, we can split it into *smaller parts*. *Each part serves one particular purpose*. 

  - We call that a "(web) service". These web services are very flexible to use, You can use them from within your existing **monolithic** application.

    - The word "micro" in "**microservices**" just confirms the idea *to make these web services as small as possible*. If you need a more complex service, it is usually better to create a new service that depends on one or more others.
  
- #### AI Pipeline:

  - Verify (If we really needs AI)
  - Data Collection (Data Gathering, Data Acquiring)
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Selection (Machine learning : Advanced statistics, Data modeling)
  - Fitting
  - Training
  - Testing
  - Save model
  - Documentation
  - Integration (Connecting the model to the system)
  - Monitoring
  - Maintenance
