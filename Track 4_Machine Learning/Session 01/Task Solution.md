# Task 01 Solution:
- #### What is Semi-supervised learning?

  - Having large amounts of unlabeled data often pose the problem of misidentification or lack of accuracy.

  - An ideal solution would always be to have a large and labelled set of data, but that requires spending a lot of time and other resources, as the data may include thousands and even millions of values.

  - Semi-supervised learning seeks to strike a balance between both the other types by eliminating the need to tediously and expensively label large data as well as improves accuracy and learning.

    This is usually done by including a small portion of labelled data in a large unlabeled set.

- #### Examples for Non Statistical Models.

  - Non-statistical, meaning it does not take a sample and use algorithms in order to validate a hypothesis. Instead, it takes input from a large volume of data and outputs the results from the data alone. This means that all the available data is taken into account.
