`Subject:` ML Introduction  

 `Date:` 20 Nov 22 `Session No.` 01

### Notes:

- **AI**

  - AI to `Generalization` (generalize a solution) and `Optimization` (the solution is the optimal solution)
  - The best solution which maximize profit and minimize cost

- **AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence)

  - AI : General Solution for Specific Problem
    - Example: Face recognition
  - AI : General Solution for General Problems ( AGI )

- Machine learning --> Data Moudling

- **Types of learning**

  - Supervised learning (defined by its use of labeled dataset)

  - 1- `Classification` :to train the model to choose correct answer between specific answers

    - Binary classification :to categorize new observations into one of two classes.
    - Categorical classification :to categorize new observations for more than two classes

    2- `Regression` : Calculate Actual value

  - Unsupervised learning (unlabeled data sets)

    - Clustering ( Grouping ) : Divide data into groups.

  - Self Supervised [Reinforcement learning, Q learning] (model corrects itself)

- **Types of models:**

  - Statistical Model.
  - Non Statistical Model.


### Tasks:

- What is Semi-supervised learning?
- Examples for Non Statistical Models.
- Solve an example (with one variable) for Linear regression.
- Solve an example (with multiple variables) for Linear regression.
