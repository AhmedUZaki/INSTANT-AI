### Notes:

#### What is statistic?

- **Statistics** is the study and manipulation of data, including ways to gather, review, analyze, and draw conclusions from data. 
- From Data we can get:
  - **Information** ---> Conclusion.
  - **Insights** ---> Read between the lines.
  - We cannot be certain that the information/Insights that we get from information are always correct, So there is a new field called **Decision Sciences**.
  
- Don't trust any statistics you didn't fake yourself.

- Statistics is the science of changing your mind under **uncertainty**.

#### How to choose a sample from a population?

- Step 1: Define the population (Domain knowledge)
- Step 2: Decide on the sample size 
  - In the worst circumstances, 30-40% max.
- Step 3: Randomly select your sample
  - Branch off the entire population into multiple **non-overlapping**, **homogeneous** groups and randomly choose final members from the various strata for research.
- Step 4: Repeat the experiment and take the average
- Step 5: Collect data from your sample
